Inspired by Deadpool 2. I can't elaborate more than that, sorry.

# Instructions:
Navigate to the project directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and change your current directory to the root of your Rust project (the directory containing Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, and the src folder).

Run the project: Once you are in the project's root directory, execute the following command:
```cargo run```

if you don't have rust installed you will get this error:
```cargo : The term 'cargo' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.Â ```

Go to the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
Follow the on-screen instructions. It will usually ask you to proceed with the default installation, which is generally fine. This process will install Rust, Cargo, and set up the necessary environment variables.

Close and Reopen your Terminal/PowerShell: After installing Rust, the changes to the PATH variable might only take effect in new terminal sessions.

Then try running cargo run again in your project directory.
